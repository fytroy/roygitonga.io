                <p>
                    System monitoring is a critical aspect of IT management, allowing us to keep a pulse on the health and performance of our machines. My **Multi-Tool System Monitor** project, built in Python, is a command-line application designed to provide quick and actionable insights into various aspects of system activity. This blog post delves into its capabilities and the technical journey behind it.
                </p>
                <h4>Motivation Behind the Project</h4>
                <p>
                    Often, I found myself needing quick glances at system metrics without firing up heavy GUI applications. Whether troubleshooting a slow network or just curious about application behavior, a lightweight, terminal-based tool seemed ideal. This led to the idea of consolidating several monitoring functionalities into one script.
                </p>
                <h4>Key Components:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Network Traffic Monitor:</strong> This component tracks real-time network usage (bytes sent/received) across the entire system. More importantly, it lists processes with active network connections, providing a granular view of who's consuming bandwidth. This was implemented using the `psutil` library, which offers a cross-platform interface for system and process utilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wi-Fi Signal Strength Logger:</strong> A crucial tool for diagnosing wireless connectivity issues. This part of the script periodically checks and logs Wi-Fi signal strength. The challenge here was accommodating different commands for Windows (`netsh wlan show interfaces`) and Linux (`iwconfig`), demonstrating robust cross-platform scripting. The data is timestamped and saved to a log file, making it easy to review historical signal quality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clipboard History Manager:</strong> This seemingly simple feature proved to be incredibly useful. It monitors the system clipboard, saving new content to a local SQLite database. The command-line interface allows users to view recent entries or search through their entire clipboard history. This was a deep dive into clipboard APIs (e.g., `pyperclip` or direct OS calls) and database management with SQLite.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Technical Challenges and Solutions:</h4>
                <p>
                    The biggest hurdle was ensuring **cross-platform compatibility**. System-level calls, especially for network interfaces and Wi-Fi, vary significantly between Windows and Linux. I used conditional logic (e.g., `sys.platform == 'win32'`) to execute the correct commands. Another aspect was managing concurrent operations, particularly for continuous monitoring like Wi-Fi logging, which required careful handling of threads or asynchronous programming to keep the main application responsive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the Clipboard History, maintaining a clean and efficient SQLite database was key. I implemented functions for adding new entries, retrieving, and searching, ensuring quick access to past clipboard data.
                </p>
                <h4>Impact and Future Work:</h4>
                <p>
                    This project has become a go-to tool in my personal toolkit for quick diagnostics and understanding system behavior. It reinforces the power of Python for system administration tasks. Future plans include adding more monitoring capabilities (e.g., specific service status, event log monitoring) and potentially a more interactive TUI (Terminal User Interface) for a better user experience.

                <h3>Automating Daily Health Checks: The Daily System Health Reporter</h3>
                <p class="post-meta">Published on <time datetime="2025-06-25">June 25, 2025</time> | Category: Automation, Windows, System Admin</p>
                <img src="images/system-reporter-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of System Health Report" class="blog-post-image">
                <p>
                    In the realm of IT operations, proactive monitoring is paramount. Manually checking system health across multiple machines can be tedious and prone to oversight. This is precisely the problem my **Daily System Health Reporter** aims to solve. This Python script automates the collection of comprehensive system metrics, generates a detailed HTML report, and emails it to designated recipients, making daily health checks effortless.
                </p>
                <h4>The Need for Automation</h4>
                <p>
                    As systems grow in complexity, ensuring their optimal performance and stability becomes a full-time job. Automated reporting frees up valuable IT time, provides consistent data points, and allows for early detection of potential issues like low disk space, high CPU usage, or stopped critical services.
                </p>
                <h4>How It Works:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensive Data Collection:</strong> The script gathers an extensive array of metrics using Python's `psutil` library and specific Windows commands (via `subprocess` and `wmic`):
                        <ul>
                            <li>CPU usage (overall, per core, frequency)</li>
                            <li>Memory usage (physical and swap)</li>
                            <li>Disk usage across all partitions, with built-in alerts for low space</li>
                            <li>System uptime</li>
                            <li>Detailed network interface information (IPs, speed, data transferred)</li>
                            <li>List of logged-in users</li>
                            <li>Total running processes</li>
                            <li>Top 5 processes by CPU and memory consumption</li>
                            <li>Status of critical Windows services (configurable)</li>
                            <li>Windows Firewall status</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic HTML Report Generation:</strong> All collected data is then formatted into a clean, easy-to-read HTML report. This report visually highlights critical information and potential issues, such as a disk running low on space or a vital service being stopped. The use of HTML makes the report universally viewable and easily digestible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automated Email Delivery:</strong> Once the report is generated, the script uses Python's `smtplib` to send the HTML file as an attachment to a predefined list of recipients. It supports SMTP authentication and TLS encryption for secure transmission.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Implementation Details and Challenges:</h4>
                <p>
                    A significant portion of this project involved interacting with the Windows operating system programmatically. Leveraging `wmic` commands through Python's `subprocess` module was key to getting specific Windows-centric data like service status and firewall information. Error handling for these external command calls was crucial to ensure the script's robustness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designing the HTML report also required careful consideration to ensure readability and effective presentation of data. I focused on clear headings, tables, and conditional formatting to make alerts stand out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Configurability was another important aspect. I designed the script to allow easy modification of report directories, email settings (server, port, sender, recipients), and the list of services to monitor directly within the script's variables, making it highly adaptable for different environments.
                </p>
                <h4>Benefits and Future Scope:</h4>
                <p>
                    This script has proven invaluable for maintaining oversight over Windows systems, providing daily snapshots of their health without manual intervention. It's a great example of how simple Python automation can lead to significant operational efficiencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future enhancements could include integration with logging systems (e.g., ELK stack), more advanced alerting mechanisms (e.g., sending SMS for critical failures), and potentially a web-based dashboard for aggregated reports across multiple machines.
